pytest expects test suites to start with "test"

	$ pytest -l
or 
	$ py.test -l
or
	$ py.test

pytest will identify each file that begins with "test" as a test suite to run,
and will run all the methods in it that start (or end) with “test”.


to restrict which tests run:
	$ python -m pytest -k "substring"
