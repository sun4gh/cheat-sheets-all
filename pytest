pytest expects test suites to start with "test"

	$ pytest -l
or 
	$ py.test -l
or
	$ py.test

pytest will identify each file that begins with "test" as a test suite to run,
and will run all the methods in it that start (or end) with “test”.




to restrict which tests run, and given

	@pytest.mark.slow
	def test_expensive_operation():
		assert heavy_computation() == 42

to run that one test:

	$ python -m pytest -k "expensive"

or, to exclude it given the marker

	$ python -m pytest -m "not slow"
