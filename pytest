pytest expects test suites to start with "test"

	$ pytest -l
or 
	$ py.test -l
or
	$ py.test

pytest will identify each file that begins with "test" as a test suite to run,
and will run all the methods in it that start (or end) with “test”.

-l means show local variables on failure

GIVEN:
	import pytest
	
	@pytest.mark.contract
	def test_schema_alignment():
		assert True
	
	@pytest.mark.integration
	def test_schema_validation():
		assert True

To run all tests:
	$ pytest
or:
	$ python -m pytest

To run all tests in a specific file:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py

To run a single specific test by exact name:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py::test_schema_alignment

To run only tests whose name contains "alignment":
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -k alignment

To exclude tests whose name contains "validation":
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -k "not validation"

To run only tests marked as contract:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -m contract

To run only tests marked as integration:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -m integration

To exclude tests marked as integration:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -m "not integration"

To combine name-based filtering and markers:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -k schema -m contract

To exclude tests by both name and marker:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py -k "not validation" -m "not integration"

To stop immediately on the first failure:
	$ python -m pytest tests/unit/test_myscript.py::test_schema_alignment -x
