ls -d */
	Will list all directories, but no files. "Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively)"
	Adding -R makes it recursive but then it lists files too.
      
ls -m
	lists files comma separated
	
	
ls -p
	add / after a directory
ls -G
	Enable colorized output (see CLICOLOR)


open files
----------

$ open -a "Sublime Text" response.html


bash Variables
---------
export name=value
	makes the variable available to subprocesses
vs.
name=value
	which does not

If you need a variable accessible via python os module, make sure it's export.
No spaces around the =


MacOS UNIX
----------
.bash_profile gets executed every time a new terminal window is launched (unlike UNIX systems)
you can 
> Subprocesses will only see the exported variables

Sound subsystem not working? No sound? Try :

Soft links

	$ ln -s remote_folder .
to create a soft link in the local directory of the remote folder
drag (if on Mac OS) the remote_folder into the terminal to properly escape it

FIND FILES WITH FILENAME TEXT
-----------------------------
	$ find . -name "*.epub" -print
also
	$ tree -P "*.epub"

FIND FILES CONTAINING TEXT
--------------------------
Simplest, case sensitive:
	$ grep -rn "text" some.path
The -r is recursive, and the -n displays the line in the file

e.g.
	$ grep -rn -C 2 "import" .
-C 2 will include two lines above and below

To limit to certain files:
	$ grep -rn -C 2 "import" *.py
also:
	$ grep -rn --include="*.py" "import" .

search whole words only with -w 
	$ grep -rnw -C 2 "port" *.py

case insensitive -i
	$ grep -rnwi -C 2 "IMPORT" *.py

ignore binary files with -I

View a summary of it all with -c (lower c):
	$ grep -rnwiHc -C 2 "IMPORT" *.py
Then view the lines by removing -c and adding coloring:
	$ grep -rnwiH --color=auto  -C 2 "IMPORT" *.py

Change the order if dirs if you prefer (multiple dirs) before the expression:
	$ grep -rnwiH --color=auto  -C 2 . -e "IMPORT"
and
	$ grep -rnwiH --color=auto  -C 2 "." -e "IMPORT"
	$ grep -rnwiH --color=auto  -C 2 ./*.py -e "IMPORT"
work.
	$ grep -rnwiH --color=auto  -C 2 . -e "IMPORT"



CHARACTERS
1. To represent characters other than latin characters, we need more than a table that can only hold 256 symbols. 
2. That table is called Unicode. Requires 4 bytes.
3. Packing these (so the computer know whether it's a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-byte character is called UTF-8
4. There are other encodings also, such as UTF-16.
