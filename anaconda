CONDA 4.6 CHEAT SHEET: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html

  UPDATING CONDA
$ conda update -n base -c defaults conda

  WHERE ANACONDA STORES ENV?
$ conda info --envs
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /anaconda3
newenv                   /anaconda3/envs/newenv

  WORKING WITH ENVs YOU ALREADY HAVE
  To activate in a terminal session:
$ conda activate the_env
  To see the packages of the current env (and their version)  :
$ conda list
  To see the history of updates in the environment:
$ conda list --revisions
  Update ALL (in this environment) to most-recent-but-compatible version:
$ conda update --all

  INSTALL SPECIFIC PACKAGE:
- consider cloning a current env first so you can work in a new env; also remember --revisions flag (see above)
- in AN check if it's already installed; or use the uninstalled choice in the drop down to find it easily

Option:
In terminal activate the environment you want to use.

  Search for the package, e.g. librosa:
$ conda search librosa
  if that fails, user top search field in anaconda.org to find the pacakage, then look at the instructions on that page, e.g.
$ conda install -c conda-forge librosa 

CONDA and JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
  1. Move to the directory of the ipynb_to_launch:
$ cd ~/git/.../<directory of ipynb_to_launch>
  2. Review your options of environments to use:

  3. Then, activate the env and confirm it has the correct version of the modules you need
$ conda activate the_env
$ conda list
