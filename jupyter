$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Export to PDF
-------------
Try download as "PDF via HTML", or
$ jupyter nbconvert <filename.ipynb> --to WebPDF

If that fails, check if you have nbconvert, pyppeteer, notebook-to-pdf
The latter is only installable via pip, it seems.

Be aware of formatting numbered lists.
You can also export to HTML (single file) then PDF that.
